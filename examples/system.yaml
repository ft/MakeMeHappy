# Ideas:
#
#     # Configure and build.
#     mmh system build [VARIANTS...]
#     # Build a single variant without a deep build tree.
#     mmh system build -s VARIANT
#     # Only rebuild, without reconfiguration.
#     mmh system rebuild
#     # Force a re-configuration.
#     mmh system configure
#     # List all specified build variants.
#     mmh system list
#     # Maybe spawn a Curses TUI for selecting build variants.
#     mmh system select
#
# Maybe find something useful to do, if called without sub-command.
